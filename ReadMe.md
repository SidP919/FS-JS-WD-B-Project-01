## What I have learnt while making this project?

> Although, I had learned about Position property few years ago, but only at a basic level, and then started using bootstrap, so never was able to get a hands-on knowledge on Postion CSS property. So, by creating this project which I have developed using only Position property and without using Flexbox CSS concept and the bootstrap, it was a big challenge for me and it has equipped me with a better understanding of how to use and work with Position property.
